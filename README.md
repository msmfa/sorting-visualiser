## Data visualiser for sorting methods

### Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort

4. Generate the function for Merge sort.
5. Add a button for those types of sort.
6. Render a visual change while the sorts are taking place.
7. Repeat for Quick and Heap sort.
8. A lot trickier than I thought to implement setTimeout method on the sort function.

##Â Bubble Sort
Compares pairs of numbers. Moved along one index and compares another paid using last index from previous comparison. Least efficient form of a sort because as the array grows the amount of swaps grows exponentially.
